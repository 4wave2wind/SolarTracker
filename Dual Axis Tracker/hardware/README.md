# Hardware

The `LDR-Board` holds the photocells. (This board has not changed since its initial design.)

The `Solar Tracker Shield v1.1` is the _old_ version of the Solar Tracker Shield. If you are using this you will need to use the Arduino sketch `Dual_Axis_Tracker_V2.ino`

The `Digital I/O Arduino Shield Type A v1.1` is the _new_ version of our general purpose I/O shield that works with the Solar Tracker. This shield will be released in the fall of 2020. If you are using this you will need to use the Arduino sketch `Dual_Axis_Tracker_V3.ino`

The `Arduino-Nano-Board` is an _older_ version of the shield meant to work with an Arduino Nano instead of an Arduino Uno.
