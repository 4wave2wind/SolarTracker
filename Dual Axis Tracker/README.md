# Dual Axis Solar Tracker V2

## Solar Tracker Shield and LDR Board

[The Light-Detecting Resistor (LDR) Board](hardware/LDR-Board) is a board with four photocells and male pin headers.

The old [Solar Tracker Shield](hardware/Solar-Tracker-Shield-v1.1) was use before the Digital IO Shield was released. If you are using the this version of the Solar Tracker Shield you will need to use the Arduino sketch `Dual_Axis_Tracker_V2.ino`

The new (as of fall 2020) [Digital IO Shield](hardware/Digital-IO-Arduino-Shield-Type-A-v1.1) is a more general purpose Arduino shield and replaced the old version. If you are using the this version of the Solar Tracker Shield you will need to use the Arduino sketch `Dual_Axis_Tracker_V3.ino`

Both of the shields for the Arduino Uno board and have male pin headers for connections of the servos and a female jumper wires to connect the light detecting resistors.

## Hardware

The majority of screws are 3/4th inch 8-32 pan head screws, one half inch 8-32 screw, one 2.5 inch 8-32 screw, along with four #2 wood screws to mount the servo horns, and two M3 screws to mount the Arduino Uno.  Rubber feet are necessary for the bottom of the base.

## Laser Cut Files

Use a laser cutter or CNC router to cut the parts out. Use 1/4th inch and 1/8th inch plywood, not acrylic, for this project. A 1 inch by 1 inch reference square has been put on the laser cut design to to allow for adjustment if importing causes resizing problems.
